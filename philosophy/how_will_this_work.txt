A sensor creates an image from the outside world.

There are several Abstractors that go to work on the image,
creating 1-D signals from it.

A bunch of 1-D processors go to work on those, 
extracting 'features' from the signals.
These are just higher-level Abstractions.

The signal-processors only post if they are happy 
enough with the result.

Some other Abstractors look at those signal-features. They do 
interesting things to the associated images based on what they 
see in those features.  They create new images, and post them.


How do those image processors know which image was the basis 
for the signal-feature they are looking at?
They know because:

    1. All posts have a unique identifier.
    2. A post can be retrieved by its identifier.
    3. Every post has a map associating its antecedent posts 
       with various aspects of it, which are represented by strings.

In this case, an interested Abstractor looks at this signal's
antecedent map, looks up which post was its image, and retrieves
that.

How does an Abstractor become aware of an input that it may want?
The Abstractions are typed, are stored in one great map with 
ID as key. 
Also stored (ID) chronologically.
When an Abstractor wants a new one, it asks the BB, and provides a
type and a timestamp.  Gets back a list of all posts of that type
after that time.
